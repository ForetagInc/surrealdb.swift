# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Renamed the Spectron client to Agent Memory: the library product and module `Spectron` is now `AgentMemory`, and the types it exports lose the `Spectron` prefix (`Spectron` → `AgentMemory`, `SpectronError` → `AgentMemoryError`, `SpectronTransport` → `AgentMemoryTransport`, and so on). Source-breaking for anyone on `v1.0.0-alpha.1`.

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- Initial SurrealDB Swift client: core query builder, table/field modeller, transport protocol abstraction (HTTP/WebSocket), CBOR codec, and integration test harness.
- Engine and codec abstraction, plus the Agent Memory SDK.
- Typed `ServerErrorKind` enum taxonomy mirroring the server's `{code, message, kind, details, cause}` wire shape, with convenience booleans (`isTokenExpired`, `isInvalidAuth`, `isTransactionConflict`, `isNotFound`, `isAlreadyExists`, etc.) (#5).
- Multi-session support: one WebSocket connection can now multiplex multiple independent sessions (namespace/database/auth/bound variables), via `newSession()`/`forkSession()`/`closeSession()`/`sessions()`, mirroring `surrealdb.js`'s multi-session model. WebSocket only — HTTP throws `SurrealError.unsupportedFeature` (#6).
- `set()`/`unset()` on `SurrealQueryable` for client-side session-scoped bound variables (#6).
- Reconnect-replay mechanism restoring a session's namespace/database/auth after a WebSocket reconnect, fixing a pre-existing bug where that state was silently dropped (#6).

### Fixed
- `QueryErrorDetail` was silently dropping `kind` for per-statement query failures; it now carries `kind` and exposes `.typedKind` (#5).
- JSON wire codec was silently dropping the `session`/`txn` fields the CBOR codec already carried (#6).
